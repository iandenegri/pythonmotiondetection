# pythonmotiondetection
Working on a script that can connect to a webcam and then detect if there's motion.
The script logs what time the motion occurs at using datetime.now and then exports it to a CSV file for use in excel.
Ideally, this can then have a second script that can create web pages with graphs so that this information can be accessable to anyone.
